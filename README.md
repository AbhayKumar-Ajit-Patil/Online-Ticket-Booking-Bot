Online Ticket Booking Bot
This project is a Flask-based web application integrated with a Selenium-powered automation bot designed to streamline the process of booking tickets from the official Arsenal website. Users can input their ticket preferences (such as match details and seat options) via a simple and interactive web interface. Once submitted, the backend bot automatically navigates through the website, applies user preferences, and proceeds with the booking process â€” all in headless mode using a Chrome WebDriver.
Built with Python, Flask, Selenium, and dotenv, the project includes environment-based configuration, data persistence through an optional database, and modular code design. It aims to reduce manual steps involved in booking high-demand football tickets, especially during peak sale periods. The system can be extended for other teams or ticketing platforms with minor modifications, and also serves as a strong example of how automation and web frameworks can be combined to solve real-world problems.
